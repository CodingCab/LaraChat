- When the user says "push":
  1. First commit all changes
  2. Check if on default branch (main/master)
  3. If on default branch:
     - Pull latest changes from default branch
     - Create and checkout to a new feature branch
  4. Push to GitHub
  5. NEVER push directly to the default branch
- When the user says "show me roadmap", read ROADMAP.md and display its content without any modifications
