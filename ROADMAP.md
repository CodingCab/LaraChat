# ROADMAP

## Issues & Tasks

### To Do

- **Planning mode switch on Claude.vue**: Add a toggle/switch for planning mode in the Claude chat interface.
- **Message visibility issue on Claude.vue page**: When a message is sent, it initially appears and is visible but then disappears. The message only reappears after the job is finished processing.
- **Duplicate initial message bug**: User's initial/first message is displayed twice at the start of conversation.
- **Refresh conversations list on message send**: When a message is sent on Claude.vue, the conversations list in the sidebar should refresh to show that the conversation is in progress.
- **Database column rename**: Change column `is_processing` to `in_progress` in conversations table.
- **Auto-hide sidebar on navigation**: When sidebar items are clicked, the sidebar should automatically hide.

### In Progress

### Completed

- **Repository name truncation bug**: When adding https://github.com/CodingCab/LaraChat, the name and slug get cut off and become "LaraCha". Repository name should be kept original. âœ…
